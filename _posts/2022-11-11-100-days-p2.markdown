Boya oh boya! Again!

Here I am reporting my evolution during this crazy #100daysofcoding. 
Continuing the trend I've decided to once more study cloud + infosec as
explained on the previous post [here](https://victornas91.github.io/scientistden/New_Journey).

Today was about the chgrp, chown, man and apt commands, their syntax, 
powers and caveats. Oh and also a little of grep and less too. Since the day was packed I could not pay much attention to studying but tomorrow is weekend and there's big plans out there!  


That's it! Hope you have enjoyed my adventure so far!

Excelsior ad Infinitum!
