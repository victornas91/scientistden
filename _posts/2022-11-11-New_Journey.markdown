Boya oh boya!

A year later and i've decided to come back here to just turn this blog into a diary about my evolution as a "multi-tech guy". I created a schedule that hopefully will work this time. It's as follows:

I'm doing a #100daysofcodingchallenge with a little twist: every new day the topic will cycle between Cloud + Infosec / IoT / Machine Learning and Applied Mathematics and Game + Mobile Dev.

Day 1 was Cloud + Infosec where i learned more about the linux system commands and how to change user access with chmod.

Also learned some more of Kali and Python by creating a simple mac changer.

That's it! Let's go!

Excelsior ad Infinitum!
