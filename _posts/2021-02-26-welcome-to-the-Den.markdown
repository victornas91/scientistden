Welcome to my place where I run cool experiments regarding Computer Science and Electrical Engineering. My focus here is what I intend to be my career in CompSci: Hardware Hacking, Pentest, Artificial Intelligence, Mobile Apps and Games. I truly hope that we can grow together as I develop my skills regarding these topics and bring them here so everyone passing through can put these posts to good use.

Cheers!
