Welcome to my place where I run cool experiments regarding Computer Science and Electrical / Mechanical Engineering. My focus here is what I intend to be my career in STEM: a lot of stuff ranging from mobile apps to hardware design and control. I truly hope that we can grow together as I develop my skills regarding these topics and bring them here so everyone passing through can put these posts to good use.

Cheers!
