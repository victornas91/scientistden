Straight to the point again! (I'm lazy today so excuse me D:) This is the improvement upon the initial youtube video downloader that i've post earlier. 
Now we are able to choose between a single video and an entire playlist! Neato! 

The code already commented is as follows:

![full]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/ytpdfull2.PNG)


But this is not his final form yet! 

(Again :D) 

Next time we will add a window to turn this script into a full desktop app!


Cheers!
