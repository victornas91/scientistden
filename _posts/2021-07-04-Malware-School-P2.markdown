Let's get to work shall we? Today we are continuing our lesson on internet safety by learning about some online threats, this time the infamous trojan!

This guy works like its greek counterpart: it carries some sort of malicious content that further damages the system. Basically it is used to "mask" an even bigger threat like a ransomware or a backdoor (we will discuss these on another post). The most common form of trojan is an exe file that comes in an email that uses social engineering to convince you to install it, usually a prize or computer game (like the recent attack on youtubers). After installing it, whatever is being carried by it will be loaded into the victim's system.  

So this is for now (again :D). Next time we will discuss the backdoor!

Cheers!
