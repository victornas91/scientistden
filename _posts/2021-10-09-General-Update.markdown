And here we go again...

Well, a lot changed since the last update posted here. I had set a bunch of goals and had fulfilled none. Both degrees i'm pursuing changed their curriculum and i've decided to use this opportunity to change my focus on them. I've also decided to not let depression and lazyness get the best of me for once. I've returned to exercice and strict dieting, and also i'm regularly stretching twice per day, which ended my post wake-up pain. Also while my marriage was not bad or declining at all, i've decided to become an even better version of myself for her and for our future.

But let's not forget about intellectual improvement shall we? One of my biggest decisions was to embrace the intertwined aspect of my career choice and become a full fledged multi-engineer. When i first created this blog i was focusing on become someone versed on computer hardware as well as generic machine parts, like a mechanical engineer. A lot happened that "showed" me that a generalist approach was better but it was just me letting people messing with my head. Now i'm back on track and stronger than ever! Below are the so called "engineering" paths i'm pursuing. Be prepared to be <strong>shocked</strong>, in <strong>awe</strong> and <strong>terrified</strong> of my ambitions, all in one go!

<strong>Machine Learning</strong> Plain and simple: artificial intelligence was always something magical to me. Well that and two of the latter topics on this list. So with the update of my degree's curriculum to increase the number of chairs of others courses accepted to be used as optative marks i've decided to fully focus on machine learning techniques to automate boring bureaucratic stuff. All of that using our great friend python. Also i can use these techs on the subjects of this list.

<strong>Embedded Systems for Aerospace</strong> I'm focusing on heading straight to Neptune, so what's better than studying embedded systems and iot to accomplish that? I'm adding C, Rust and Assembly to my utility belt now. No one can stop me now! Also this will help me with some of the other topics discussed here!

<strong>Networks</strong> Let me tell you a lil' secret: i'm a script kid ( D: ). I don't wanna be like this anymore ( D: ). I'm switching my approach to this by studying hardware vulnerabilities since i'm also on the whole embedded systems boat, both curriculums complete each other.

<strong>Software</strong> Not much to say here: i'm following my android passion and becoming a mobile dev with the ambition of building a system focusing on freedom (so poetic and brave i know!).

<strong>Game Development</strong> Last but not least, i need to put my creativity somewhere and that's where game development enters. But there's more! Since i <strong>also</strong> love 3d graphics and newer techs, i'm focusing game dev stuff with with cg programming and blockchain implementation. Who knows, maybe i'll create the new crypto game wave!

And that's that. I've opened my heart to the internet today and now i'm going to sleep. And as MLK said :

"Every man must decide if he will walk on the light of altruistic creation, or the shadow of egotistical destruction"

I've decided to destroy this world so who's with me?


Excelsior ad Infinitum!
