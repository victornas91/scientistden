Straight to the point! This is a simple code to help you all download youtube playlists! Taken directly from the pytube library, it allows us to download entire playlists from our beloved red stream giant (take that Netflix! JK love ya too :D). With some basic python functions, i've arranged a way to organize the process by adding a folder that you can rename at your leisure to ensure proper data organization. So here it is, with the code already commented:

![full]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/ytpdfull.png)


But this is not his final form yet! Next time I'll add options so we can choose between a single video or an entire playlist!


Cheers!
