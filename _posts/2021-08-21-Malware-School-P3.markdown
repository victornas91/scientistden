As discussed before, now we will talk about the the title chracter of this chapter, the backdoor. Basically speaking, the backdoor is an advanced tool used to take control of a system. It's 90% of the time carried by a trojan or phising attack, and since these other guys seems to be so sophisticated
it's a common assumption that they are the main threat. But no, the backdoor is the real mastermind. The name is taken from the real backdoors that,
just like this virus, it's main use is to direct a "guest" to enter the facility through a adjacent entrance. The backdoor does that and goes beyond:
it's main feature is that it leaves the "backdoor" of the infected system open to other attacks, to be used whenever the attacker wants, like injecting other malicious content.

So that's all folks! Next time we will discuss internet safety actions and measures! 


Cheers!
